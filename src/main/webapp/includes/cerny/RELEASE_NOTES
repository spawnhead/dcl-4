Release notes for Cerny.js

1.4.0 (2007-05-20)
  - Added support for programming by contract by the means of
    CERNY.pre, CERNY.post, CERNY.check and
    CERNY.Interceptors.ContractChecker. Thanks to Norman Harebottle
    III for pointing out that this should be possible!
  - Added CERNY.clone for cloning object. It is implemented very
    naively and does not deserve its name at the moment, but cloning is
    necessary for programming by contract.
  - Modified the function Array.prototype.append to accept null and
    undefined.
  - Added method CERNY.util.getUriParameterValue.
  - The TypeChecker interceptor does not check the return value on
    call, where an exception occurred anymore. This was disguising the
    real exception with a quite meaningless one.
  - Refactored lib to use anonymous functions as namespaces.
  - Changed interface to CERNY.js.doc.Generator. The constructor must
    be called with new now and is passed the source. Sorry!

1.3.1 (2007-04-04)
  - CERNY.load loads the scripts now, so that non-anonymous (global)
    functions are available in window.
  - Loggers provide now the following additional methods:
    isFatalEnabled, isErrorEnabled, isWarnEnabled, isInfoEnabled,
    isDebugEnabled, isTraceEnabled.
  - Exceptions occurring in intercepted methods are either logged as an
    ERROR or printed to the console, if the responsible logger does not
    have ERROR enabled.

1.3.0 (2007-04-01)
  - CERNY.load has a default implementation now. This means that with a
    proper CERNY.Configuration.Catalog, the dependencies can be omitted
    from the HTML page. It uses a synchronous XMLHttpRequest call to
    retrieve the necessary scripts. The DOM-based solution of inserting a
    script tag failed, because of concurrency issues.
  - CERNY.Configuration.Catalog is correct and only needs manual
    configuration of the cerny.js.path to work properly.
  - Added a root level for logging.
  - Added a console package holding consoles (An object providing a print
    method, taking one parameter a message).
  - Added the definition of XMLHttpRequest for ie6.
  - Fixed bug in CERNY.json.Printer: Curly braces in strings do not
    confuse the printer anymore and produce a proper result.
  - Files added:
    - js/console/console.js
    - js/console/DomElement.js
    - js/console/PopupWindow.js
    - css/console.css

1.2.1 (2007-03-22)
  - Improved CERNY.intercept to log information when reapplying
    interception and to log the name of the logger of the subject.
  - Added interception and signature to all scripts in CERNY.json.
  - Removed unnecessary dependency from CERNY.js.doc.Schema.
  - Corrected signature of CERNY.util.indent.

1.2.0 (2007-03-17)
  - Interceptors are passing on exceptions now and always call the
    after method.
  - In the function CERNY.intercept the passing of a customized
    interceptors array is possible.
  - Added parameter to CERNY.method to allow passing of a customized
    interceptors array. The new parameter is optional and defaults to
    CERNY.Configuration.Interceptors.active. Semantics of the function
    did not change.
  - Logging was extended to allow configuration of the layout and
    multiple appenders in CERNY.configure.
  - Corrected CERNY.js.doc.Schema.Package.path to accept empty Strings.
  - Corrected CERNY.js.doc.Schema.Library.version to be of type VersionNumber.
  - Functions added:
    - CERNY.joinFunctions
    - CERNY.signature
    - CERNY.checkType
  - Fixed bug in CERNY.util.parseUri. The meaning of the split
    function differs from IE to Firefox. In IE "dev/".split(/\//)
    yields an array of length 1. In Firefox of length 2. This caused
    the path_segments of the URLs to be wrong in IE.

1.1.0 (2007-02-19)
  - Moved configuration into a single, central configuration file
    cerny.conf.js, which must be loaded before cerny.js.
  - Introduced the interception concept to the library and adapted some
    core functions and the schema package to it.
  - Extended the signature of CERNY.schema.arrayOf to accept two
    additional parameters for checking the size of the
    array. These are optional.
  - Fixed bug in function Array.prototype.append. It works now as
    expected, appending an array to an array.
  - Fixed bug in function Array.prototype.contains. It works now as
    expected, returning whether an object is contained in an array or
    not.
  - Functions added:
    - CERNY.util.getNameFromFqName
    - CERNY.util.parseUri
  - Files added:
    - cerny.conf.js
