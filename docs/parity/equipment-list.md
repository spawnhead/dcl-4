# equipment-list Parity Map (100% required)

## Scope
- **Legacy:** JSP `src/main/webapp/jsp/EquipmentList.jsp`, Struts mapping(s): `<form-bean name="EquipmentList" type="net.sam.dcl.form.EquipmentListForm"/>`; `<action path="/EquipmentListAction" type="net.sam.dcl.action.EquipmentListAction" input=".EquipmentList" name="EquipmentList"/>`.
- **Modern:** route `/equipment-list` (controller: `EquipmentListController` / `EquipmentListController.java`), template ``modern/src/main/resources/templates/equipment-list.html``, service `EquipmentListService.java`, DTO `EquipmentListDto.java`.

## Fields mapping
| Legacy property | New DTO/Entity | Type | Validation | Readonly cond | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `list` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_id` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `fullList` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `crq_equipment` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `ctn_number` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `stf_name` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_serial_num` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_year_out` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_usr_id` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_usr_fullname` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `lps_enter_in_use_date` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |
| `mad_complexity` | `id` (approx) | string/flag (by control type) | Legacy: UI/dispatch-driven; Modern: no explicit Bean Validation in scaffold | editable (unless role/grid checker) | Derived from JSP controls and modern template fields. |

## Actions
| Dispatch/Button | New endpoint | Params | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input/show/process` (legacy pattern) | `GET /equipment-list`, `GET /equipment-list/{id}`, `POST /equipment-list` | screen DTO/form params | Legacy Struts dispatch vs Modern MVC handlers. |

## Grids
| Grid ID | Columns | Inline ops | Totals |
|---|---|---|---|
| n/a or not explicit in JSP | n/a | n/a | n/a |

## Print/Export
| Type | Params | Output format | Parity check |
|---|---|---|---|
| No dedicated print/export command found in inspected JSP/dispatch for this screen | — | — | Parity treated as N/A unless screen-specific print action exists outside current scaffold. |

## Validation
- Legacy: validation is primarily defined by Struts dispatch flow, DAO/SQL constraints, and JSP control semantics.
- Modern: most generated screen controllers/services/DTOs are scaffold-level and typically do not enforce Bean Validation annotations.

## Readonly conditions
- Readonly behavior in Legacy is taken from JSP `readonly="true"` and grid readonly checker usage where present.
- Modern templates should mirror those readonly rules field-by-field; current scaffold pages often expose generic fields and may require hardening for full runtime parity.
